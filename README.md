# StyleWave Library 

**This project is under the copyright of Mohammad Hossein Anbarlou (Mehrab Anbarlou).**

StyleWave is a free open source library for CSS and JavaScript that you can use to develop your projects. Using StyleWave can make the development of your projects faster and easier. With StyleWave, you can use a large number of ready-made styles and animations in CSS by entering the class name in HTML, and there is no need to go to css and enter styles for some elements.

### Important thing
There is currently no JavaScript code for the library. We recommend using CSS styles.
Currently, my goal in developing this project is to develop CSS styles, but in future updates and versions, I will add more effective and practical JavaScript codes to the repository.

If you find a bug in the StyleWave library, please let me know in Telegram or GitHub.
